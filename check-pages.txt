GitHub Pages Configuration Check Steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/varACundefined/izju-china-wiki-remake
2. Click on the 'Settings' tab at the top
3. Click on 'Pages' in the left menu
4. Check the 'Build and deployment' section:
   - Source should be set to 'GitHub Actions'
   - If not, select 'GitHub Actions'
5. Check 'Custom domain' if you have one set
6. Check the 'Deployments' section to confirm deployment status

If GitHub Actions deployment fails, you can:
1. View Actions logs: Click on the 'Actions' tab, select the latest deployment workflow
2. Check error messages and fix accordingly
3. Manually trigger deployment: Click the 'Run workflow' button

Common issues and solutions:
- Path issues: Ensure the public directory exists and contains an index.html file
- Permission issues: Check the permissions configuration in the workflow file
- Branch issues: Ensure you're pushing to the correct branch (master)
