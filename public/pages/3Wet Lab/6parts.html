<td>mecA</td>
<td>The mecA gene encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), an alternative transpeptidase with low affinity for 尾-lactam antibiotics. This protein allows methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to maintain cell wall synthesis even in the presence of penicillins and cephalosporins. As a result, mecA confers resistance to nearly all 尾-lactam antibiotics, making it a key determinant of MRSA pathogenicity and persistence.</td>

<td>lacZ</td>
<td>The lacZ gene encodes 尾-galactosidase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose. In molecular biology, lacZ is widely used as a reporter gene for blue-white screening and gene expression studies. In this project, lacZ serves as a model target gene for CRISPR-Cas9 detection and cleavage assays, enabling visualization and quantification of the DNA origami-guided gene editing system's activity.</td>

<td>sgRNA-L transcription template</td>
<td>A double-stranded DNA construct that serves as the template to transcribe sgRNA-L. It places a T7 promoter upstream. The transcribed RNA comprises a lacZ-targeting spacer, the canonical gRNA scaffold for Cas9 binding, and a linker complementary to the linker sequence of S-PAM-cap strands. Its expected behavior is to produce sgRNA-L that anchors to the DNA origami and recruits Cas9 to lacZ target sites; the DNA template itself has no structural role in the origami.</td>
