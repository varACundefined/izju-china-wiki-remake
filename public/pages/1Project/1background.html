<h1 class="hero-title">Global Antimicrobial Resistance Crisis</h1>
<p>The global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has already been quantified on a large scale. An analysis in <em>The Lancet</em> (2022) reported that <strong>in 2019, approximately 4.95 million deaths were associated with bacterial resistance, of which 1.27 million were directly attributable to resistance</strong> (1). Without intervention, AMR-related deaths are projected to reach <strong>10 million per year by 2050</strong>, surpassing the mortality rate of cancer, and to cause a <strong>cumulative economic loss of USD 100 trillion</strong> (2). Clinically, resistance significantly increases the risk of procedures dependent on antibiotics, such as routine surgery, caesarean section, and chemotherapy. Data from the United Kingdom indicate that approximately <strong>10% of postoperative infections are caused by resistant bacteria</strong> (3). Thus, resistance is not only a medical issue but also a combined threat to public health and socio-economic systems.</p>
<h2>Resistance-Transmissibility Coupling</h2>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance (<strong>AMR</strong>) and transmissibility (<strong>infectiousness/transmissibility</strong>) show a mutually reinforcing relationship in many bacterial diseases. Resistance leads to treatment failure, thereby prolonging the infectious period; while highly transmissible strains are more likely to spread resistance genes within populations. This <strong>"resistance + transmissibility" coupling effect</strong> is an important reason why resistant bacteria are so difficult to control (4).</p>
<p>At the level of transmission dynamics, there exists a significant positive feedback between resistance and transmissibility. In the classical <strong>SIR model (Susceptible鈥揑nfectious鈥揜ecovered)</strong>, epidemic potential is usually expressed by the <strong>basic reproduction number (R鈧€)</strong> (5).</p>
<p>Its approximate formula is:</p>
<div class="formula">
<span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">R<sub>0</sub> = 尾 脳 c 脳 D</span>
</div>
<p>where 尾 is the transmission probability per contact, c is the contact rate, and D is the infectious period. Therefore, <strong>resistance-induced prolongation of the infectious period directly increases R鈧€</strong>, enhancing the transmission capacity of resistant bacteria (D 鈫?leads to R鈧€ 鈫? leading to higher transmissibility).</p>
<p>A longer carriage period further increases opportunities for spread, giving resistant strains a population-level advantage that makes them harder to eliminate, often showing epidemiological features of <strong>"delayed peaks, slow decline, and long persistence"</strong> (4). Studies have shown that MRSA can circulate simultaneously in both hospital and community settings, a <strong>"dual ecological niche"</strong> that makes its resistance more difficult to eradicate (6).</p>
<h2>MRSA: A Paradigm of Dual Threat</h2>
<p>Among resistant pathogens, <strong>methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA)</strong> exemplifies this dual threat. It is not only a leading cause of hospital-associated infection deaths, resulting in more than <strong>100,000 deaths annually</strong> (1), but in some countries, its proportion among <em>S. aureus</em> isolates has long exceeded <strong>30鈥?0%</strong> (7). MRSA has the dual characteristics of healthcare transmission (causing sepsis, pneumonia, and postoperative infections) and community transmission (causing outbreaks of skin and soft tissue infections) (7,8). Environmental monitoring has shown that <strong>the positivity rate of MRSA on subway handrails and hospital equipment surfaces can reach 2.5鈥?.8%</strong>, and <strong>46.3% are coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS)</strong>, which often serve as "intermediate hosts" for mecA (9). Because of the combination of high resistance and strong transmissibility, MRSA has been listed by the WHO as a <strong>"high-priority resistant pathogen"</strong> (10).</p>
<h3>Molecular Basis of MRSA Resistance</h3>
<p>The core of MRSA resistance lies in the acquisition of the <strong><em>mecA</em> gene</strong>, which is usually located on the mobile genetic element <strong>staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec)</strong> (11). <strong><em>MecA</em></strong> encodes <strong>penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a)</strong>, which has very low affinity for 尾-lactam antibiotics. Even under antibiotic pressure, bacteria can continue peptidoglycan cross-linking and cell wall synthesis. This <strong>"target replacement"</strong> mechanism forms the molecular basis of MRSA resistance. Structural biology studies have clearly revealed how the unique conformation of the PBP2a active-site pocket prevents 尾-lactam binding, explaining the stability and persistence of MRSA resistance (12).</p>
<h3>Horizontal Gene Transfer Dynamics</h3>
<p>However, a single resistance gene does not exist in isolation but is in constant dynamic flow. Through <strong>horizontal gene transfer (HGT)</strong>, mecA can rapidly spread among different strains. <strong>Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS)</strong> are considered the main gene reservoir and intermediate host of SCCmec, frequently detected in both clinical and environmental isolates (9). Epidemiological investigations show that MRSA strains often carry different SCCmec types, indicating that this element is constantly recombined and redistributed in populations, thereby enhancing the transmissibility of mecA (11).</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT)</strong> is the key mechanism driving the dissemination of mecA. Studies have shown that MRSA can acquire SCCmec fragments via phage-mediated transduction, and under antibiotic stress (especially at sub-inhibitory concentrations, sub-MIC), the bacterial SOS response is induced, integrase and recombinase activities are enhanced, and the frequency of HGT is significantly increased (13鈥?6). High levels of mecA-bearing plasmids and transposons have even been detected in environmental waters and wastewater treatment systems, suggesting that resistance genes can spread across hosts and ecosystems (17).</p>
<p>In clinical settings, <strong>hospitals and communities become amplifiers of HGT</strong>. In hospitals, the high density of patients and healthcare contacts, frequent and high-dose antibiotic use, and the formation of <strong>biofilms</strong> on catheters and ventilators collectively create a hotbed for resistance gene exchange. Experiments have confirmed that gene transfer rates are much higher in the biofilm state than in planktonic cells, and biofilms are the typical survival form of MRSA in catheter-related bloodstream infections and prosthetic joint infections (18). In addition, crowded contacts and irrational antibiotic use in communities also provide supplementary channels for MRSA transmission (7,8).</p>
<h2>Our Innovative Solution</h2>
<p>In response to the coupled challenge of <strong>resistance + transmissibility</strong> represented by MRSA, our strategy is not to further escalate or replace antibiotics, but to <strong>eliminate the resistance gene itself</strong>. Specifically, we employ <strong>CRISPR-Cas9</strong> as a tool to precisely cut and inactivate the <strong><em>mecA</em> gene</strong>, restoring the susceptibility of resistant strains to 尾-lactams and thereby converting MRSA to MSSA. This <strong>"de-resistance"</strong> strategy is fundamentally different from traditional bactericidal or bacteriostatic approaches: it aims to weaken the ecological advantage of resistant bacteria and reduce their persistence in populations (19).</p>
<h3>CRISPR-Cas9 Selection Rationale</h3>
<p>In choosing gene-editing tools, we focused on <strong>CRISPR-Cas9</strong>. Compared with other systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cas9</strong> depends on <strong>NGG PAM</strong>, which is widely present in <em>mecA/SCCmec</em> regions, enabling efficient recognition and cleavage of target sequences;</li>
<li><strong>Cas12a (Cpf1)</strong> can generate sticky ends, but PAM availability at target sites is lower, limiting its application;</li>
<li><strong>Cas13</strong> mainly acts on RNA, making it more suitable for suppression of expression rather than permanent gene removal;</li>
<li><strong>Base editing or Prime Editing</strong> are more complex and require larger vectors, making them unsuitable for rapid deletion of resistance loci in bacterial genomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, Cas9 is the most feasible system in terms of maturity, toolchain, and direct applicability to disrupting mecA (19).</p>
<h3>DNA Origami Delivery Platform</h3>
<p>The central challenge, however, lies in <strong>delivery</strong>. The double-layer barrier of bacterial cell wall and membrane, clearance by the host immune system, and potential exposure of non-target strains all make delivery the decisive factor. To this end, we selected <strong>DNA origami</strong> as the delivery platform. DNA origami has several advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Biocompatibility and biodegradability</strong>: as a material, DNA itself has low immunogenicity and a safer boundary than some polymers or viral vectors;</li>
<li><strong>Multivalency and programmability</strong>: origami structures can be modified with <strong>aptamers</strong> on the surface to achieve MRSA-specific recognition, while densely loading Cas9/sgRNA complexes in the internal cavity;</li>
<li><strong>Stimuli responsiveness and controlled release</strong>: through disulfide "locks," origami can be triggered to unfold in the reductive intracellular environment (such as high glutathione concentration), releasing Cas9 precisely;</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced membrane permeability</strong>: modification with <strong>G-quadruplex-hemin (G4-hemin)</strong> at the ends allows local ROS generation in the presence of H鈧侽鈧? mildly disrupting bacterial membranes to facilitate cytoplasmic entry without excessive damage (19).</li>
</ol>
<h2>System Advantages</h2>
<p>In summary, we designed an <strong>antimicrobial system using DNA origami as a delivery platform and CRISPR-Cas9 as the "de-resistance" tool</strong>. Its key advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Precision</strong>: targeting mecA to directly eliminate the resistance gene;</li>
<li><strong>Controllability</strong>: gated release and ROS-assisted penetration enable precise spatiotemporal control;</li>
<li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: by replacing sgRNAs and surface aptamers, the strategy can be extended to other resistant species and loci (19).</li>
</ul>
