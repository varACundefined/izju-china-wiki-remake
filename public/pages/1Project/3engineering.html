<details>
<summary>Design (D)</summary>
<p>The threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) does not originate from a single pathogen or gene, but from a complex spectrum of resistant organisms and determinants: CRE (carbapenem-resistant <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>), VRE (vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em>), MRSA (methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>), and key resistance genes such as <em>bla</em>, <em>van</em>, and <em>mecA</em>. Attempting to address all of them simultaneously would dilute focus, hinder closed-loop validation in modeling and experiments, and obscure innovation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the goal of DBTL1 was to establish a <strong>stepwise filtering logic</strong>: from <strong>epidemiological burden at the pathogen level</strong> 鈫?<strong>mechanistic centrality at the gene level</strong> 鈫?<strong>detectability and translational potential</strong>, ultimately converging on the most rational template for our project.</p>

<h3>(1) Pathogen-level screening</h3>
<p>We constructed a <strong>two-strain SIRD (Susceptible鈥揑nfectious鈥揜ecovered鈥揇eceased) competition model</strong> to simulate the dynamics of 鈥渞esistant strain vs. susceptible strain鈥?within the same population. This allowed us to compare epidemiological outcomes across candidate resistant pathogens.</p>

<p>By substituting parameters from different candidate pathogens, we directly compared their epidemic peaks, duration, and cumulative mortality鈥攖hereby identifying which resistant strains impose the heaviest burden.</p>

<p>These results show that <em>mecA</em> positivity is nearly equivalent to phenotypic resistance, while <em>mecA</em>-negative isolates rarely exhibit resistance. In other words, <em>mecA</em> is both the mechanistic core and the most reliable clinical marker.</p>

<h1>DBTL2: CRISPR-mecA Cleavage</h1>
<details>
<summary>Design (D)</summary>
<p>In DBTL1, we have chosen the聽mecA gene聽as a representative antibiotic resistance gene, which combines a stable molecular mechanism of resistance with dynamic gene mobility (1,2).</p>
<p>To address this issue, we proposed a new strategy: eliminate the resistance gene itself, thereby removing the resistance and preventing its horizontal transfer to other bacteria. We selected聽CRISPR/Cas9聽technology for the targeted cleavage of the mecA gene, given its high feasibility for directly disrupting the mecA gene (3). This approach provides a fundamental solution to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance at the genetic level.</p>
<p>To design the target sequence, the ChopChop tool (https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no) was used (Figure 1). After evaluating multiple potential sequences, we selected the rank 2 target sequence: TGGCAAAAAGATAAATCTTGGGG, with 0 mismatches and an efficiency of 67.83% (Figure 2).</p>

<p>Based on the mecA target sequence (TGGCAAAAAGATAAATCTTG), we identified the corresponding guide region (UGGCAAAAAGAUAAAUCUUG). We then ordered the sgRNA-螖mecA from Genscript, which was adapted for the Cas9 system and contained this guide region.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Test (T)</summary>
<p>After the sgRNA-螖<em>mecA</em>/Cas9 complex was formed, it was incubated with the <em>mecA</em> gene fragment. The cleavage was assessed by performing DNA gel electrophoresis. In the experimental group where the <em>mecA</em> gene was incubated with the sgRNA-螖<em>mecA</em>/Cas9 complex, the 2004bp <em>mecA</em> gene fragment was cleaved into two fragments of approximately 700bp and 1300bp (Figure 3). In all other control groups, only a single band of approximately 2000bp was observed, indicating no cleavage.</p>

<summary>Learn (L)</summary>
<p>Since the target sequence begins approximately at the 1300th nucleotide of the 2004bp-long mecA gene, the gene was expected to be cleaved into two fragments of around 1300bp and 700bp, which aligns with our experimental results. This confirms that the designed guide region is effective and can successfully target the mecA gene for cleavage using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.</p>
<p>However, direct application of the sgRNA/Cas9 complex to target and cleave antibiotic resistance genes in resistant bacteria is not feasible. The complex must overcome cell membrane barriers and face challenges of poor stability (4). Therefore, an effective delivery system is crucial to ensure that the CRISPR/Cas9 complex can successfully reach the target and function in vivo.</p>

<h1>DBTL3: Origami-CRISPR Delivery</h1>
<h2>3.0 Origami-CRISPR Delivery</h2>
<details>
<summary>Design (D)</summary>
<p>DNA origami was selected as the delivery method for the CRISPR/Cas9 system, given its low immunogenicity, programmability, and stimuli-responsive release (1). We referenced the literature and decided to use rectangular-shaped DNA origami structures because the yield of well-formed rectangles was high, with minimal breakage or folding (Figure 1) (2).</p>
<div class="pdf-viewer-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="/static/_downloaded/static.igem.wiki/teams/5913/dbtl/3-1.pdf#zoom=page-width"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Design of the basic rectangular DNA origami structure (DO). DO is constructed using the M13mp18 phage genome as the scaffold strand (black long single strand), which is folded into a rectangular shape by staple strands (S, black short single strands). Each numbered position in the figure represents a specific location on the scaffold strand, essential for the accurate design of the rectangular structure.</p>
<p>The next step was to modify both the sgRNA and the DNA origami to enable the interaction between the DNA origami and the sgRNA/Cas9 complex. Considering that it is unsafe to conduct experiments with MRSA and <em>mecA</em> models, we chose <em>Escherichia coli</em> (<em>E. coli</em>) MG1655 as the model organism and <em>lacZ</em> gene as the target gene to ensure feasibility and safety. We created a modified version of sgRNA targeting <em>lacZ</em>, termed sgRNA<sub>L</sub>, by adding an extra linker sequence (GGGUGGUGCCCAUCCUGGUC) at its 3' end. This linker was designed to base-pair with complementary sequences on the DNA origami, ensuring stable binding. Additionally, we incorporated complementary sequences matching the linker into selected staple strands of the origami. Preliminary calculations indicated that the diameter of the Cas9 protein is approximately one-fourth of the width of the DNA origami rectangle. To provide sufficient space for Cas9 protection within the complex environment of the wound, we deliberately excluded staples near the edges. After balancing the available space and the need for efficient loading, we selected six staples in the middle. These complementary sequences, along with a PAM-capturing sequence, were incorporated into the same staple strands (S-PAM-cap) of the origami to facilitate binding with the modified sgRNA<sub>L</sub> and to enhance Cas9 recruitment by increasing the local concentration of potential Cas9 binding sites (Figure 2).</p>

The modified staple strands, shown in red, are labeled as S-PAM-cap, which captures PAM-rich. Each numbered position in the figure corresponds to a unique site on the scaffold strand, indicating precise staple placement.</p>
<p>To enable visual tracking of the assembly and loading process, the DNA origami was labeled with Cy5 (red) by introducing F-cap and Cy5-labeled F-H (Figure 3), while the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex was labeled with FITC (green).</p>

<p>We obtained the transcription template for sgRNA<sub>L</sub> from GenScript and amplified it using PCR. The sgRNA<sub>L</sub> was then transcribed in vitro, and we purified it to obtain high-quality RNA and labeled it with FITC. The DNA origami was assembled by slowly annealing the M13mp18 scaffold, S, S-PAM-cap, PAM-rich, F-cap, and F-H. Once assembled, the FITC-sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex was loaded onto the DNA origami.</p>

<summary>Test (T)</summary>
<p>To confirm the stability of DO, we built the DNA origami and conducted molecular dynamics simulations within the dry lab. Using oxDNA, a platform specific for molecular dynamics simulation of DNA origami, we acquired figures of "Trajectory Inspection", "Energy Monitoring", "RMSD and Alignment", "RMSF and Mean Structures", "Base-Pairing Statistics", and "Global Metrics". The results illustrated high stability of the origami, though set in high temperature and with more than ten thousand steps of simulation.</p>
<p>Atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging was used to verify the successful assembly of DO<sub>PAM</sub>GH. In AFM imaging, the DO<sub>PAM</sub>GH maintained the rectangular shape (Figure 4A). Height analysis of a selected single rectangular DO<sub>PAM</sub>GH shows that the length and the width of DO<sub>PAM</sub>GH are also in line with our expectations (Figure 4B). These structural values indicate the successful assembly of DO<sub>PAM</sub>GH.</p>

<p>To validate the successful loading of the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex onto the DNA origami, we used UV-Vis spectroscopy to measure the absorbance of the system. The DNA origami carrying the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex exhibited absorption peaks at both 495 nm (FITC) and 650 nm (Cy5), confirming the presence of both components (Figure 5). This result validated that the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex had been successfully incorporated into the DNA origami, and the system was ready for further application in gene editing.</p>

<p>The successful design and assembly of the DNA origami structure, along with the functional sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex, demonstrated the feasibility of using DNA origami as a delivery platform for CRISPR/Cas9 systems. The incorporation of fluorescence labeling allowed for the precise tracking of the complex, confirming that the loading and assembly processes were successful. The AFM imaging and UV-Vis spectrometry results further validated the structural integrity of the system. Moving forward, the next step will be to overcome bacterial cell membrane barriers for in vivo delivery. However, the current results lay a solid foundation for optimizing the delivery mechanism and further exploring the potential of DNA origami as a gene-editing tool.</p>

<h2>3.1 Modify sgRNA</h2>
<details>
<summary>Design (D)</summary>
<p>We designed a modified version, termed sgRNA<sub>L</sub>, by adding an extra linker (sequence: GGGUGGUGCCCAUCCUGGUC) at its 3鈥?end. This linker is intended to form complementary base pairing with specific sequences on the DNA origami, thereby enabling stable binding. The reason behind this design was to utilize an intrinsic mechanism within bacterial cells to release the sgRNA/Cas9 complex. RNase H is a key enzyme that is widely present in bacteria and essential for maintaining genomic stability, as it cleaves the DNA-RNA hybrid region (1). This enzyme naturally recognizes and cleaves DNA-RNA hybrids, which is exactly what would occur between the sgRNA<sub>L</sub> and the DNA origami. Although RNase H does not require specific sequences, it prefers certain structural features of DNA. Our design, based on prior studies, aligns with these features, allowing RNase H to efficiently recognize and release the sgRNA/Cas9 complex within the bacterial system.</p>
<p>To eventually test whether DNA origami carrying the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex can be delivered into bacteria for targeted gene editing, we initially considered MRSA and its resistance gene <em>mecA</em> as a potential model. However, carrying out experiments with MRSA presents significant biosafety risks. After an extensive literature review, we chose <em>Escherichia coli</em> (<em>E. coli</em>) MG1655 as the model organism instead to ensure feasibility and safety. We targeted the <em>lacZ</em> gene because its phenotypic changes are easy to monitor: on X-gal indicator plates, colonies with intact <em>lacZ</em> appear blue, whereas those with disrupted <em>lacZ</em> appear white (2). This provides a straightforward and reliable readout for evaluating gene-editing outcomes.</p>
<p>To design suitable sgRNA target sites for <em>lacZ</em>, we used the ChopChop tool (https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no). After evaluating multiple potential sequences, we selected the target sequence CTGGGGAATGAATCAGGCCACGG. The decision was supported by the repair outcome predictions (Figure 1). Specifically, this site exhibited a high frameshift frequency (70.08%), indicating that cleavage at this locus is highly likely to disrupt the reading frame of <em>lacZ</em>. Moreover, the high microhomology deletion frequency (68.79%) suggests that error-prone repair is effectively activated at this site, helping <em>E. coli</em> survive CRISPR/Cas9-induced double-strand breaks that might otherwise be lethal (3). Taken together, these statistical features strongly support the use of this sequence as a robust target for functional knockout of <em>lacZ</em>.</p>

The statistical predictions of repair outcomes for the <em>lacZ</em> target sequence (CTGGGGAATGAATCAGGCCACGG) were obtained using the ChopChop tool. The analysis reveals a high frameshift frequency (70.08%), indicating a strong likelihood of disrupting the reading frame of <em>lacZ</em> upon cleavage. Additionally, the microhomology deletion frequency is relatively high (68.79%), suggesting that error-prone repair pathways are activated efficiently, minimizing the risk of lethal double-strand break repair outcomes in <em>E. coli</em>. These predictions support the selection of this sequence for functional knockout of <em>lacZ</em>.</p>
<p>Based on the <em>lacZ</em> target sequence (CTGGGGAATGAATCAGGCCA), we identified the corresponding guide region of sgRNA (CUGGGGAAUGAAUCAGGCCA). Considering both synthesis time and cost, we decided to produce sgRNA<sub>L</sub> through in vitro transcription. We first designed a transcription template containing a T7 promoter, the guide region of the sgRNA, the gRNA scaffold, and the linker sequence (Figure 2). An additional G was placed immediately downstream of the T7 promoter to enhance transcription efficiency. Between the sgRNA sequence and the linker, we inserted four thymidines (TTTT), which function as a spacer region to minimize potential structural interference and ensure that the linker and sgRNA retain their respective functions.</p>

The template is amplified by PCR (middle left), followed by in vitro transcription (IVT) using T7 polymerase, which synthesizes large quantities of sgRNA<sub>L</sub> from the template in the presence of NTPs (middle right). The final step involves product purification, yielding high-quality sgRNA<sub>L</sub> suitable for downstream applications (right).</p>

<p>To further investigate whether the addition of a linker at the 3鈥?end affects the function of the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>, we first PCR-amplified a 2001 bp DNA fragment from the <em>lacZ</em> gene region of <em>E. coli</em> MG1655, which contains the sgRNA target site. Subsequently, the sgRNA<sub>L</sub> was incubated with Cas9 protein to assemble a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. This RNP complex was then incubated with the <em>lacZ</em> PCR fragment under appropriate reaction conditions. To evaluate whether the <em>lacZ</em> fragment was successfully cleaved, we performed agarose gel electrophoresis on the reaction products (Figure 4). Given that the target sequence is located at positions 657-677 within the 2001 bp fragment, successful cleavage is expected to yield two DNA fragments of approximately 670 bp and 1330 bp. The observed band pattern on the gel matched these theoretical sizes, confirming that the addition of a 3鈥?linker does not impair the function of the sgRNA.</p>

<p>The cleavage results confirmed that the sgRNA<sub>L</sub> retained full function even after the addition of a 3鈥?linker, as evidenced by the expected ~670 bp and ~1330 bp bands observed in agarose gel electrophoresis.

<p>However, modifying the sgRNA alone is not sufficient to enable hybridization with the DNA origami structure. To achieve stable base-pairing between the sgRNA and DNA origami, complementary sequences must also be incorporated into selected staple strands of the origami that match the linker region of the sgRNA.</p>

<h2>3.2 Modify DNA Origami</h2>
<details>
<summary>Design (D)</summary>
<p>To enable base-pairing between the modified sgRNA<sub>L</sub> and the DNA origami structure, we designed complementary sequences that match the 3鈥?linker region of the sgRNA and incorporated them into selected staple strands of the DNA origami. These complementary sequences were added to the 5鈥?end of the chosen staples, facilitating the hybridization of the sgRNA with the origami through Watson-Crick base pairing. Preliminary calculations indicated that the diameter of the Cas9 protein is approximately one-fourth of the width of the DNA origami rectangle. To provide sufficient space for Cas9 protection within the complex wound environment, we deliberately excluded staples near the edges. After balancing the available space and the need for efficient loading, we chose six staple strands in the middle (102, 103, 104, 113, 114, and 115) as the insertion sites.</p>
<p>In addition, to further enhance the recruitment and stable binding of the Cas9 protein, we inserted a PAM-capturing sequence between the complementary region and the original staple sequence (Figure 1). This intermediate segment is designed to hybridize with PAM-rich DNA strands, thereby increasing the local concentration of potential Cas9 binding sites and promoting more stable association of the sgRNA/Cas9 complex with the origami scaffold. These six modified staple strands are collectively referred to as S-PAM-cap.</p>

<p>The AFM images indicate that the DNA origami was correctly folded according to the design, confirming the structural accuracy of our design. However, the functionality of the structure remains to be further verified, particularly whether the origami can effectively load sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 for its intended function.</p>
</details>
<h3>3.3.1 FITC-Cas9</h3>
<details>
<summary>Design (D)</summary>
<p>To investigate whether our designed DNA origami can correctly load the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex, we fluorescently modified the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex and DNA origami with different fluorophores. If we successfully detect the two distinct fluorescence signals, it will indicate that the loading process was successful. Firstly, we considered labeling the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex.</p>
<p>To characterize the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex, different colored fluorescent groups were intended to be attached to it. FITC (green, excitation wavelength = 495nm, maximum emission wavelength = 525nm) is a common fluorescent-modified molecule (Comparatively, the reason why we don't directly use EGFP is that it is too large and does not meet the size requirements of our DNA origami structure). The isothiocyanate moiety (-N=C=S) on FITC reacts with amino-terminal and primary amine groups on the target biomolecule to form a covalent thiourea bond, and the resulting fluorescein conjugates can be used as specific probes in several applications (1).</p>
<p>For the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex, we initially planned to label Cas9 via FITC. The reason is that Cas9 has many lysines distributed across its surface, providing abundant, accessible sites for labeling with NHS-ester dyes like FITC. This makes the reaction efficient and reliable. Meanwhile, the FITC-labeled protein technology has become very mature, and we have found that in the previous studies for CRISPR systems, the Cas9 protein was usually selected as the target for labeling, also highlighting that it achieved a high "degree of labeling".</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Build (B)</summary>
<p>We first perform desalting on the purchased Cas9 to replace the original solvent provided by the supplier with PBS. Subsequently, Cas9 was diluted to the desired reaction concentration, and the corresponding concentrations of FITC-labeled reagent and labeling buffer were added according to the pre-designed reaction system. After incubation at 4掳C for 1 hour in the dark, the termination buffer was added, and binding continued for an additional 15 minutes. The Cas9 (160 kDa) samples were then purified using a G-25 Mini Deionization Column to remove unbound FITC, thereby minimizing potential fluorescence interference in subsequent experiments. The eluate was collected, and the absorbance at 280 nm and 495 nm was measured using a Nanodrop and a UV spectrophotometer. Finally, the recovery rate, product concentration, and labeling efficiency were calculated.</p>

<p>To prevent the accidental loss of valuable samples, small-scale desalting was carried out. However, even after multiple optimizations, the recovery rate is still not ideal, with a significant sample loss rate (Table 1).</p>

<p>By recovering and measuring the filtration from the purified column, a simple recovery graph was obtained, in which the first peak is the FITC-Cas9 we needed (Figure 1). The desired product was recovered at the bottom of the first peak, but the loss rate was extremely high, and the yield was not ideal (Table 2). The SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of the products did not reveal any bands. One possible reason could be the insufficiently loaded protein.</p>

<p>After measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and 495 nm, a significant loss of the Cas9 protein was observed during the pre-desalting and purification steps, resulting in a yield that did not meet the expected value. Meanwhile, the flow-through efficiency of the G-25 column was relatively low, likely due to the small sample volume. Given the experimental conditions, we did not use molecular sieves; instead, we manually collected each milliliter of the eluate until no protein remained. As a result, the purification process was both complex and time-consuming. Furthermore, the volume of the eluate was substantial, and the product concentration was relatively low, requiring further concentration before it could be used in subsequent experiments. Due to the high price of the Cas9 protein, the amount of protein available to us is very limited. This poses a challenge for us to further optimize the experimental conditions and expand the reaction system. To label the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex, an alternative choice was to label the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>.</p>

<p>Due to the high price of Cas9 and the large amount needed to achieve a high concentration of FITC-Cas9, we decided to give up using FITC-modified Cas9. Instead, we reconsidered the strategy of using FITC modification on the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>. But the target sites for modification are far more limited to nucleic acids, compared to proteins. One approach is to modify the amino groups attached to the tail end of the nucleic acid during the synthesis process. The other method is to directly modify the amino groups on the A and C bases (2). The latter method has lower labeling efficiency but more potential labeling sites, which was selected for use. Meanwhile, considering that the efficiency of modifying nucleic acids is generally lower than that of modifying Cas9, we replaced FITC with FITC-NHS ester to enhance the modification efficiency.</p>

During the first purification step, the unreacted fluorescein will remain in the supernatant, while the fluorescein-labeled precipitate will appear dark brown. The presence of a white precipitate indicates that the reaction was unsuccessful. This can act as secondary evidence to examine if the labeling is successful. Similarly, the absorbance values at 260nm and 495nm were measured using a nanodrop after purification, and the recovery rate, product concentration, and labeling efficiency were calculated.</p>

<p>This method proved to be unfeasible due to the interference caused by the green fluorescence of the DNA marker, which made it difficult to distinguish whether the observed green fluorescence in the origami structure came from the DNA itself or from the FITC-sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex. We suspected that the gel stain or the loading buffer could be affecting the fluorescence, so we removed these factors and repeated the experiment, but the issue remained unresolved. We speculated that the issue was caused by mismatched instrument channels for FITC and Cy5, but replacing the instrument was impractical, so we abandoned this method. Considering both FITC and Cy5 fluorescence exhibit absorption peaks at specific wavelengths, we decided to explore utilizing these absorption peaks to investigate whether the sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 complex can be loaded onto our designed DNA origami.</p>

<p>To overcome the barriers posed by bacterial cell membranes and cell walls, we chose to use G4/hemin complexes since DNA origami provides a programmable scaffold for spatially organizing multiple G4/hemin motifs. The G4 (G-quadruplex) structure, when combined with hemin, forms a DNAzyme for catalytic oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to generate ROS, which aids in disrupting the bacterial wall and membrane (1). To integrate G4 into the DNA origami, we selected specific staple strands and appended the G4 array sequence GGGTAGGGCGGGTTGGG to the 3' end of these staples, and these modified staples are called S-G4 (Figure 1). The specific site choices, density, quantity, and order of assembly for G4/hemin lack normalized standards corresponding to different forms of DNA-origami. General principles guiding site choice for functional staple strands (2) advise against locations that are near the edge of the origami structure to avoid structural errors. To affirm whether connecting to the 3' end or the 5' end will result in the staple protruding towards the desired side, we referred to statistics provided in DNA-nanotube models (3). Crowding of G4/hemin leads to a lowering of its catalytic efficiency (4), so we must compromise between the density and quantity of G4/hemin. Finally, to refine the synthesis protocol, we decided to first allow the assembly of G4 and the DNA-origami and then add hemin, instead of assembling G4/hemin beforehand, given the instability of the G4/hemin complex (5). After analyzing the characteristics and interaction between G4/hemin and DNA-origami, we comprehensively designed a new DNA-origami with 136 copies of G4. Considering that fluorescence tracking is not required for practical applications of the DNA origami, the staples corresponding to the fluorescent sites from DBTL3 were also selected and modified by adding the G4 array.</p>

<p>We mixed M13mp18, S, S-G4, and S-PAM-cap and assembled the scaffold structure by slow annealing. Afterward, we added the PAM-rich strands and slowly annealed them to integrate into the structure. Considering that the incorporation of sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 did not contribute to the evaluation of the membrane-disrupting effect of the G4/hemin complex, the DNA origami used in the following experiments did not carry sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9. Finally, we added hemin to the assembled DNA origami to form the G4/hemin complex.</p>

<p>G4s are introduced to disrupt the bacterial membrane. However, they are known to exhibit a strong tendency to dimerize through stacking interactions, which can influence the structure and functions of DNA origami (6). To examine whether the new DNA origami structure exhibited dimerization, we subjected DO<sub>PAM</sub>G to agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 2). The results revealed a similar single band of DO<sub>PAM</sub>G to that of DO<sub>PAM</sub>, with an approximate size double that of M13, indicating correct folding and the absence of dimerization.</p>

<p>To verify whether hemin was successfully incorporated into the DNA origami to form the G4/hemin complex, we performed a UV鈥揤is assay on the DNA origami (Figure 3). Since hemin exhibits an absorbance peak around 400nm in the presence of DO<sub>PAM</sub>G (7), the presence of a distinct peak around this wavelength in our samples confirmed the successful loading of hemin and the formation of the G4/hemin complex.</p>

<p>To further evaluate the peroxidase-mimicking activity of the G4/hemin complex, we performed an ABTS assay. The DNA origami was incubated with ABTS, and then the absorbance at 415 nm was measured (8) (Figure 4). This absorbance reflects the concentration of oxidized ABTS, which correlates with the peroxidase-mimicking activity of the G4/hemin complex. Our results demonstrated that the G4/hemin loaded on DNA origami exhibited higher peroxidase-mimicking activity compared to an equivalent amount of free G4/hemin complex.</p>

<p>Though the peroxidase was generated efficiently, we simulated in silico that it won't harm the DNA origami itself, sgRNA, and Cas9 protein loaded on it. We performed a cross-section where they are most likely to be harmed (Figure 5). Then, with simulation for more than 10 thousand steps, there was no or limited ROS entering the origami, and even less ROS that reached the protein. The final percentage of the harm of protein and sgRNA is lower than 3 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>To directly assess the effect of DNA origami on bacterial membrane disruption, we employed the NPN assay. In this assay, increased membrane permeability allows greater uptake of NPN, leading to enhanced fluorescence intensity. After incubating the bacteria with the DNA origami structures, we added NPN and measured the fluorescence as an indicator of membrane permeability (Figure 6). The results showed that the DNA origami induced a significant increase in membrane permeability, with an effect even stronger than that of EDTA, the positive control.</p>

<p>The results above demonstrate that the DNA origami structure we designed is correctly assembled and does not undergo dimerization, indicating that both our design and assembly methods are effective. Additionally, the results show that the DNA origami, when modified with G4 and hemin, exhibits strong peroxidase-like activity and can disrupt bacterial cell membranes to increase membrane permeability. This property enhances the likelihood of successfully delivering sgRNA<sub>L</sub>/Cas9 into the cells.</p>
<p>Although the DNA origami structures have demonstrated promising membrane-disrupting abilities, the incorporation of aptamers for targeting can further enhance membrane permeability. Aptamers, by enabling selective targeting of specific cells, could improve the efficiency of membrane disruption while potentially minimizing damage to human cells. This approach could be particularly useful in improving the precision and safety of DNA delivery systems.</p>

<h3>4.1.1 Preliminary NPN Uptake Assay</h3>

<summary>Design (D)</summary>
<p>To measure the membrane permeability of bacterial cells incubated with DO<sub>PAM</sub>GH, we performed an NPN uptake assay. The hydrophobic fluorescent probe N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN), which fluoresces weakly in aqueous environments but exhibits strong fluorescence in phospholipid conditions, has been widely used to evaluate the membrane integrity of bacteria (1). Due to the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane, the lipophilic fluorescent probe cannot thoroughly permeate the intact bacteria. When the outer membrane is disrupted by permeabilizers, NPN can access the phospholipids and exhibits surges in fluorescent intensity (1).</p>

<p>The NPN uptake factor for the EDTA group was significantly lower than the values reported in the literature (1). After ruling out other possible causes, we suspect that the high fluorescence of the buffer group or the low fluorescence of the EDTA group may be the reason for this discrepancy. Upon reviewing a large amount of literature, we found that the high fluorescence of the buffer could be due to the use of transparent 96-well plates (1,2), and the low fluorescence in the EDTA group might be due to the use of PBS as the buffer, as the effect of EDTA in PBS is weak and may not effectively enhance bacterial cell membrane permeability (3). To avoid these problems, the black plate and Tris buffer should be used.</p>

<h1>DBTL5: Aptamer-Targeted DNA Origami</h1>
<details>
<summary>Design (D)</summary>
<p>To enhance the membrane disruption efficiency of DNA origami while minimizing damage to human cells, we plan to incorporate a targeted aptamer into the DNA origami structure. When screening for feasible aptamers, we pursued two approaches to identify suitable aptamer sequences. The first approach involved searching aptamer databases, with the hope of finding sufficient data to enable the application of machine learning techniques for building a more comprehensive mechanism. The second approach involved reviewing relevant literature to find aptamer data, which would allow us to leverage previous research ideas. Both methods yielded progress: we identified pertinent papers that provided the aptamer sequences we needed, and we also located a global nucleic acid aptamer database where we found a suitable aptamer (sequence: CCATCCACACTCCGCAAGGGTGCCCCGGGGGGCTGTTCAGCGTGGTGGTGGGATGCCGTGTTGGTCCTTAGTCTCCGTCGTCGGCTGCCTCTACAT). Unfortunately, the database contained too few aptamers for methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA), limiting our ability to proceed with machine learning-based work.</p>
<p>Given that the model used for experimental validation is <em>Escherichia coli</em> MG1655, we employed an aptamer sequence that has been validated in the literature to specifically target <em>Escherichia coli</em> (sequence: CATATCCGCGTCGCTGCGCTCAGACCCACCACCACGCACC) (1). To enable the aptamer and the DNA origami to be connected through base pairing, we added a linker to the 3' end of the aptamer (C-APT), designed to be complementary to the origami structure (linker sequence: TTTTTCGCTTATTATTATTATTATTA). Subsequently, we incorporated 12 staple strands on the DNA origami that contain complementary sequences to the aptamer linker sequence at its 5' end (Apt-cap), allowing it to pair with the aptamer (sequence: TAATAATAATAATAAGCGTTTTT) (Figure 1). This ensures that the aptamer can bind to the DNA origami through base pairing facilitated by the complementary sequences. Considering that aptamers have a more complex structure than linear DNAs, they are more likely to interfere with each other if placed in the middle of the DNA origami rectangle. Additionally, aptamers would bind to the target more effectively if they were not obstructed by other functional staples. Therefore, we positioned the aptamers along the short sides of the DNA origami. For the placement pattern, we referenced the work of Li et al. and added two additional adjacent aptamers in the middle of the short side to ensure efficient targeting (2).</p>

<p>To verify the targeting effect of the aptamer, we decided to assess it using an NPN assay indirectly. If the aptamer has a targeting effect, the origami with the aptamer should exhibit a better membrane disruption effect, as the aptamer can help the origami accumulate around the bacteria. Fluorescence was not required for this experiment, so the constructed origami did not include F-cap and F-H, which is consistent with Figure 1.</p>
<p>For the construction of the DNA origami for the NPN assay, we mixed M13mp18, S, S-G4, S-PAM-cap, and Apt-cap and assembled the scaffold structure through slow annealing. Afterward, we added the PAM-rich strands and aptamer strands, and slowly annealed them to integrate into the structure. Since the incorporation of sgRNA/Cas9 did not contribute to the evaluation of the membrane-disrupting effect of the G4/hemin complex, the DNA origami used in the subsequent experiments did not carry sgRNA/Cas9. Finally, we added hemin to the assembled DNA origami to form the G4/hemin complex.</p>
<p>To visually assess the targeting effect of the aptamer and whether it facilitates the internalization of the DNA origami, we decided to incubate the origami with or without the aptamer with bacteria and observe them using a laser confocal microscope (LSM). To determine whether the origami accumulates around the bacteria or enters the bacteria, both types of origami in the experiments needed to be fluorescently labeled. The assembly process of the origami was nearly identical to that used in the NPN assay, except that F-cap and F-H were included.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in the targeting validation experiment by LSM, we were primarily interested in observing whether the origami accumulates around the bacteria. If the origami enters the bacteria, it could interfere with the results. Therefore, in the origami constructed for the targeting validation experiment by LSM, we did not include S-G4 (Figure 2).</p>

<p>For the experiment investigating whether the aptamer can facilitate the internalization of the origami, both F-cap and S-G4 were required.

The results demonstrated that the NPN fluorescence of bacteria incubated with aptamer-functionalized DNA origami was significantly higher than that of bacteria incubated with DNA origami without the aptamer (Figure 4).

<p>Our experimental results demonstrate that the aptamer we used for targeting <em>E. coli</em> is effective and can increase the probability of DNA origami internalizing into the cells. However, the issue of poor stability of Cas9 remains unresolved. After reviewing the literature, we discovered that rolling rectangular DNA origami into tubular structures to encapsulate sgRNA/Cas9 can improve its stability (3). This approach has become our next step in the project.</p>

<h1>DBTL6: Lock-Enhanced DNA Origami</h1>

<summary>Design (D)</summary>
<p>To enhance the stability of the sgRNA/Cas9 complex during application, we decided to introduce a new staple to roll the rectangular DNA origami structure into a tubular shape, referred to as S-Lock. We incorporated a DNA strand that is complementary to the frame at both ends of the origami, aiming to fold the rectangular structure into a tube (Figure 1). Additionally, we introduced thiol groups to each strand so that adjacent S-Lock structures could form disulfide bonds, further stabilizing the overall structure. To optimize the unutilized staples on the long sides, we placed disulfide bonds in the middle of 8 staples on each side. This arrangement strengthens the bond between the two sides, facilitating the transformation of the origami rectangle into a tube. Yin et al. used a similar number of staples for side-to-side binding, which demonstrated an appropriate density of functional staples (1). Furthermore, the length of their staples that do not pair with the scaffold is similar to ours. Based on this, we assume that the adjacent staples will not interfere with each other, and the likelihood of incorrect pairing is minimal.</p>

<p>The process of folding from a rectangle to a tube was explored through previous studies. Approaches such as thrombin-loaded tubular origami (2) and tissue plasminogen activator-loaded tubular origami (1) have been successfully achieved. Our cargo, the Cas9 protein, shares similarities with thrombin and tissue plasminogen activator, as all three proteins feature a high-density positively charged region. Additionally, it was highlighted that DNA backbones carry a negative charge, which repels negatively charged molecules (1). Based on this, we hypothesized that the DNA origami could fold into a complete tube, driven by the interaction between the positively charged cargo and the negatively charged DNA backbone.</p>

<p>We mixed M13mp18, S, S-G4, S-PAM-cap, and Apt-cap, and assembled the scaffold structure by slow annealing. Afterward, we added the PAM-rich strands and aptamer strands, slowly annealing them to integrate into the structure. Then, we incorporated the sgRNA/Cas9 complex and slowly annealed the mixture. Subsequently, we added the lock strands and performed slow annealing again. Finally, we added hemin to the assembled DNA origami to form the G4/hemin complex.</p>

<summary>Test (T)</summary>
<p>To verify the protective effect of the cylindrical structure on the sgRNA/Cas9 complex, we planned to incubate DNA origami with or without Lock, containing sgRNA/Cas9, with Proteinase K, followed by SDS-PAGE to assess the amount of Cas9 remaining. If the origami with the Lock strand showed more remaining Cas9, while the group without the Lock strand showed less, it would indicate that the Lock strand indeed provides a protective effect. However, when preparing for the experiment, we realized that the concentration of our DNA origami was too low (5 nM) and the amount of Cas9 protein was insufficient. Even without Proteinase K digestion, the Cas9 was not detectable by SDS-PAGE. Given the experimental conditions, increasing the origami concentration was not feasible. Therefore, we abandoned the wet-lab experiment to demonstrate the protective effect of the tubular structure on sgRNA/Cas9 and considered using a dry-lab approach instead.</p>
<p>In the dry-lab, we quantified the degradation process of the tubular DNA origami by multiple enzymes through an enzyme diffusion kinetics model combined with Monte Carlo simulation methods (3). The simulation process integrates parameter initialization, time-step iteration, result statistics, and visualization modules, with statistically significant results obtained through multiple independent runs. Tests reveal an overall enzyme entry probability of only 4.0%, with average final stability maintained at 1.000, indicating limited degradation effects. Neutrophil elastase exhibited the highest entry frequency due to its high concentration (1000 ng/mL) and small size (Rh = 1.96 nm), whereas MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2) failed to enter owing to low concentration and larger size.</p>
<p>The simulation process includes parameter initialization, time-step iteration, statistical analysis, and visualization. Multiple independent runs ensure statistical significance. After the simulation, the overall probability of enzyme entry is 4.0%. The average final stability of the tubes is 1.000, indicating limited degradation. Among the enzymes tested, neutrophil elastase displayed the highest entry frequency, which could be attributed to its high concentration (1000 ng/mL) and small size (Rh = 1.96 nm). In contrast, MMP-2 could not enter the nanotubes due to its low concentration and larger size. In summary, the result showed that little or no enzyme could enter the tubular DNA origami, which confirmed the protection of the origami and the application of our system.</p>

<p>Given the experimental conditions, we abandoned the wet-lab experiment to demonstrate the protective effect of the tubular structure on sgRNA/Cas9 and considered using a dry-lab approach instead. On the programmatic aspect, several optimizations and corrections were made during development: a parameter error in the Brownian motion visualization function (c 鈫?color) was fixed, type hints were enhanced to improve code reliability, and a minimum value protection was added to the diffusion coefficient calculation to prevent division-by-zero errors. Furthermore, the synergy matrix was expanded (e.g., the synergy factor between MMP-9 and elastase was set to 1.2), and the Brownian motion trajectory simulation function was enhanced, deepening the model's capability to describe complex biophysical processes.</p>
<p>From a biological perspective, though we already simulated typical and abundant enzymes that may harm the Cas9 protein, more complex situations still exist. In the future, we may conduct deeper research on different attributes of enzymes to better simulate their unique features. Also, we will increase the variety of enzymes to fit more practical applications.</p>
